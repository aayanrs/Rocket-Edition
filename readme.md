Rocket Edition is a ROM hack of Pokémon FireRed, and is available freely to download here: https://bit.ly/pkmfrrocketed

This repository contains all XSE scripts, assembly code, graphics and music used to create the final game.

The file "offsets.txt" lists the offsets in the ROM where relevant tables and ASM routines have been inserted. A list of flags and variables, including story progression conditions where they are set, is included in "vars and flags.xlsx". A list of ROM hacking tools used, as well as a .rbh file that defines XSE constants for scripts are also included.
