Rocket Edition is a completed ROM hack of Pokémon FireRed, and is available freely to download here: https://bit.ly/pkmfrrocketed

This repository contains all XSE scripts, assembly code, graphics and music used to create the final game.

The file *offsets.txt* lists the offsets in the ROM where relevant tables and ASM routines have been inserted. A list of flags and variables, including story progression conditions where they are set, is included in *vars and flags.xlsx*. A list of ROM hacking tools used, as well as a .rbh file that defines XSE constants for scripts are also included in the *tools* folder. The curious may also see the *doc* folder for the original plot outline and game design plans.
