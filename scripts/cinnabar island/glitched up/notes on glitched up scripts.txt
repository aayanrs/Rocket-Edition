"We seem to be safe from the
madness inside the Pokémon Center[.]
Oh, what are we going to do?"

"The island seemed to suddenly twist
and transform[.] I can't tell up from
down anymore!
And it all seems to be coming from that
shadow by the eastern shore[.]"

"I don't know what to make of this
madness, really.
But if you need a Pokémon with Surf
to go face that shadow by the shore,
I'll sell you one for [$]1,000."
"Hey, much obliged. You go face that
thing at your own risk, I say."
"Ah[.] worth a shot, though?
A crisis is the best time to make money,
hehehe[.]"
"Hm[.] you're out of cash?
Geez, you're unprepared, aren't you?
Fine-- I'll take what you have and
leave it at that."
