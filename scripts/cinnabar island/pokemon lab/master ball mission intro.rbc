#org @fujiTalk
= Mr. Fuji: No!\c\h08ó\nWhat is this criminal doing here?\pBill, you can't be serious..!\pDo you know what this Rocket here\ndid to me, how he[.]\c\h08ó he--

#org @billTalk
= Bill: Quiet, Fuji.\pIf [player] stole candy from one of\nyour orphans, I'm sure he's sorry.\pThe project we're about to realize\nis way bigger than your personal\lvendettas, don't you understand?

#org @billTalk2
= Bill: [.]\pNow, then.\c\h08ó\nWe should be all ready.\pTake a seat, [player], and let's\nget down to business.

#org @billTalk3
= Bill: Listen up.\pIt seems as if the only Master\nBall prototype is about to fall\linto Giovanni's hands.\pIt would have saved me a lot of\ntrouble to get it myself[.]\p(Er-hem!)\c\h08ó\n[.]but so be it.

#org @billTalk4
= I had a good look at the finished\nblueprints and committed them to\lmemory.\pIf we can't get ahold of that\nMaster Ball prototype[.]\lWhy, we'll just make our own.

#org @billTalk5
= This brief window of time before\nMaster Ball becomes publicly\lavailable[.]\pIt's our unique chance to capture\none of the most powerful Pokémon\lin existence[.]\pI'm not going to let it go to\nwaste.

#org @fujiTalk2
= Mr. Fuji: So that's what this is\nabout, is it?\pThat's why you brought us out\nhere?\pAnother blue-eyed expedition to\ncapture Mewtwo?\pThat's ridiculous!\nIt'll never work!

#org @blaineTalk
= Blaine: [.]\c\h08ó\nHe's right, you know.\pRemember Mewtwo's genetic makeup?\pWe engineered it with an immunity\ntowards the standard Poké Ball\lcapture mechanism.\pUnless it actively chooses to let\ndown its guard[.]\pNot even this Master Ball can have\nany chance of catching it[.]

#org @billTalk6
= Bill: I know, I know! I was right\nthere with you, wasn't I?\p[.]\c\h08ó\n(Sigh[.])\pNo, you simple-minded old fogeys[.]\c\h08ó\nI'm not talking about Mewtwo.\pLet Lance and Giovanni run circles\naround that beast all they like[.]\lThey seem to enjoy it.

#org @billTalk7
= Bill: Don't you see, people?\pHow this Master Ball is going to\nlet us tie up one of our biggest\lloose ends, once and for all[.]\pOne that's haunted more than the\nthree of us for so many years..!

#org @blaineTalk2
= Blaine: But[.]\c\h08ó Bill!\c\h08ó\nS-surely you don't mean..!

#org @billTalk8
= Bill: I do.\pNow.\c\h08ó\nListen to me.

#org @billTalk9
= The three of us can manufacture\nour own Master Ball in a\lrelatively short period of time[.]\pThere are a few practical matters,\nhowever[.]\pThat we're going to need some help\nto pull off.

#org @billTalk10
= Bill: This is where you come in,\n[player].

#org @billTalk11
= Bill: I'm going to need your help.\pI hate asking favors of anyone,\nbut it is what it is.\pIf nothing else, [player][.]\pI promise I'll make it worth your\nwhile.\c\h08ó Many times over.

#org @billTalk12
= What I need from you is really\nvery simple.\pNumber one[.]\pDeep in Viridian Forest, I've\nplanted a particular rare breed of\lJohto Apricorns.\pAt least one of them should have\nsprouted by now; go pluck it and\lbring it here.

#org @billTalk13
= Second, and more importantly,\n[player][.]\pI need access to your Rocket\nscientists' pirated Silph\ltecnhology.\pRansack the Rocket Lab on the\nmain floor of your HQ in Celadon.\pI have it on good record that your\npeople have made replicas of\lSilph's latest high-end Poké Ball\lprocessing chip.\pGrab one and bring it to us, as\nsoon as conceivably possible.

#org @billTalk14
= [player].\pYou have no idea what great\nthings are at stake here[.]\pNor the rewards that are in store\nfor you if you cooperate.\pDo what I ask, and you will not\nregret it.

#org @billTalk15
= Now, gentlemen!\p[.]\pWe have work to do.
